                <h3>Our Innovations</h3>
                <p>
                    On September 3, 2014, iConnect proudly launches the next generation of voice and data communications. 
                    iConnect Advanced 4G LTE is an entirely new HSPA+/LTE voice and data network that offers crystal 
                    clear voice service and wireless data speeds of up to 21 Mbps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    iConnect Advanced is an end to end Alcatel-Lucent network, the same network that has 
                    been supplied to Verizon and AT&T by Alcatel-Lucent. This brand new HSPA+/LTE network with 
                    leading 4G technology supports a wide selection of smartphones from major manufacturers. 
                    The iConnect Advanced network is Public Safety rated to ensure continued operations under 
                    adverse conditions.

                <p>
                    With our signature Push-To-Talk (PTT) digital cellular and text messaging technology on 
                    both prepaid and postpaid platforms, based on Motorola's cutting-edge iDEN® technology, 
                    our subscribers have enjoyed the fastest and widest PTT network coverage in the region since 
                    the year 2000.

                <p>
                    In 2013, we bring to Guam another first: iCONNECT™ True LTE 4G, an all-new network technology 
                    that provides a faster way of connecting to the Internet. And, alongside our GSM cellular 
                    network Buddy, we offer more affordable and wider choices for our subscribers to customize 
                    their telecommunications experience, allowing them to have the best and most innovative 
                    wireless telecommunications service that is fit for their needs.

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1999, iCONNECT™ took over Motorola's existing mobile radio network on Guam and Saipan, 
                    and deployed a next-generation, enhanced, and specialized mobile radio service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two years after our 2001 debut on Guam, iCONNECT™ extended its services to Saipan and, by 
                    the spring of 2004, Tinian and Rota were added in the network—uniting all four islands for 
                    the first time and offering the widest coverage by one service provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, iCONNECT subscribers enjoy huge savings from Nationwide Minutes, one of our 
                    distinctive call services that allow calls to all 50 U.S. states, at the cost of doing a 
                    local phone call.
